\section{Foundations}

Mr Shannon's information theory is based on a number of mathematical principles. Some choices have been made, and we'll explain them below. The founding principles can be summed up roughly as the choice of the logarithm and the use of entropy. To make these principles easier to understand, we have developed solutions in Python, notably by implementing a bot that plays the game Wordle.
